            Travel the world no matter how old you are! According to bcg, people between ages of 16 and 34 years are more interested in travelling. Today, travelling is not that hard because there are so many facilities and conveniences that allow you to take an extended tour around the world in as little as $8,000.
            Today, people are more interested in finding out about the cultures of other countries rather than partying. This involves the occasional backpacking trips and living in remote places for the sake of gaining some peace and quiet.
